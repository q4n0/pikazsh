- **Configuration Update**: Replaces your `.zshrc` file with the one from the repository.
- **System Cleanup**: Removes all temporary files and directories created during the installation process.

## End Product

- **ZSH as Your Default Shell**: ZSH will be set as your default shell if it wasnâ€™t already.
- **`term` Executable**: A compiled `term` executable will be available system-wide, accessible by typing `term` in your terminal.
- **Updated `.zshrc`**: Your `.zshrc` file will be replaced with the one from the repository.
- **Clean System**: Temporary files and directories used during installation will be deleted.
